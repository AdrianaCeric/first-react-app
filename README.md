# First web app using React
For a while now, I was super interested in learning the React framework after hearing about it at Hack The North. More and more projects I work on, whether it be apps built using React Native, or websites call for this framework and it's praised reusable components. 

I had a lot of fun learning this!

### Inspiration
This app was created with instructions from an Intro to React workshop by [Leslie Xin](https://github.com/lesliexin) at [Hack The North 2020++](https://hackthenorth.com/)
