# First web app using React ⚛️
I had a lot of fun learning this!

-----

### Inspiration
This app was created along with the Intro to React workshop by [Leslie Xin](https://github.com/lesliexin) at [Hack The North 2020++](https://hackthenorth.com/)

### Components
In this project, there are two components: app and dish. The following component tree is a really good way to visualize the flow of data within throughout the parent and children components. Each dish will have a unique name and count. 

- Props are the parameters/arguments that a function recieves. In this case, the parent, "App", transfers the "name" parameter to the children, "Dish." Cannot be changed. 
- State is also data that belongs to the component, but is **local to each instance of a component** meaning that each dish will have its own unique count. Can be changed.

### What are React Hooks?? ⚓
In React, hooks are simply methods that allow you to create React Components without writing a class. This alleviates the need for constructors, and the annoying `this.` that you have to append to any property of the class.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
